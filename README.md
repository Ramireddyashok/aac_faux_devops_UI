### Fake Devops for UI Work

This is third project in a series of TTFHW projects, in response to [this blog challenge](https://betterologist.net/2016/07/you-are-a-failure-full-stack-2016-if/) to become a true 2016 full stack developer.

In the challenge, it is mentioned that **_devops capabilities are required to make for a true full stack developer_**.

### Why Fake It?

I have been doing devops on and off for 3 years now, using Chef, 
Ansible, bash, Camel, groovy. I also previously used various aspects of CI/CD including Bamboo, 
Jenkins, others. Not to mention the many conferences and dozens of devops meetups.

I am completely convinced that this field is absolutely necessary, not very hard,
and in a state of almost ridiculous flux. At least, in 2016.

So I just said to heck with it, for this TTFHW project. A bash script is fake devops, but it works. And it's enough 
to get me through this, claiming a fake-ish kind of victory.

### How does it work?

You are not expected to actually run this, because it requires secrets not provided.

If you knew the secrets, you would run deploy.sh as a bash script.

Be sure to learn Devops on your own, if you don't already know 3 or 5 approaches or so. It can be maddening, 
but well worth it, if you want to claim "Full Stack" as your capabilities.
